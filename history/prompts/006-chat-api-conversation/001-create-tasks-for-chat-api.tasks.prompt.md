# Create Tasks for Chat API Implementation

## Overview
Created the task breakdown for the Chat API, Conversation State & Full-Stack Integration feature (Spec 6). This defines the specific implementation tasks needed to build the chat API with conversation persistence, AI agent integration, and frontend components.

## Changes Made

### Tasks Document
- `specs/006-chat-api-conversation/tasks.md` - Complete task breakdown with:
  - 11 phases from setup to polish
  - 47 individual tasks with proper IDs and labels
  - User story mapping (US1-US8)
  - Dependencies between tasks
  - Parallel execution opportunities
  - Implementation strategy

## Key Features
- Phase-based organization from setup to end-to-end testing
- User story mapping for independent development and testing
- Proper task dependencies and sequencing
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- MVP scope defined (US1 - Chat Endpoint Implementation)
- Complete implementation path from foundation to polish

## Verification
- All tasks follow required format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
- Dependencies properly defined between related tasks
- User stories mapped to appropriate phases
- Parallel execution opportunities identified for efficiency
- Task descriptions include specific file paths for clarity

## Outcome
Complete task breakdown ready for development team to execute with clear organization and dependencies.
