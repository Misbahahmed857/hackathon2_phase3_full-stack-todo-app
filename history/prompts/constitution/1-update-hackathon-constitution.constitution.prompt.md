## Prompt

```
## Hackathon II – Spec-Driven Agentic Full-Stack Development

## 1. Purpose

This constitution defines the governing rules and constraints for Hackathon Phase II.

The objective is to transform a console-based Todo application into a secure, multi-user, full-stack web application using a spec-driven, agentic development workflow powered by Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

This hackathon evaluates development process, architectural discipline, and agentic execution rather than manual coding.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Spec-Driven Development

All work must begin from a written specification.
Specifications are the single source of truth.
Code must always trace back to an approved spec.

### 2.2 Agentic Execution

All application code must be written by Claude Code.
Humans may only write or update specifications and review generated changes.
Manual coding is strictly prohibited.

## 3. Mandatory Rules

### 3.1 No Manual Coding Rule

Humans must not write, edit, or refactor application code directly.
All code changes must be generated by Claude Code.
Violation of this rule invalidates the phase.

### 3.2 Spec Compliance Rule

Claude Code must explicitly reference relevant specs during implementation.
Any behavior change requires a spec update before implementation.

## 4. Approved Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 16+ (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Better Auth

### Backend
- Python FastAPI
- SQLModel ORM

### Database
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL

### Development Tools
- GitHub Spec-Kit Plus
- Claude Code

No unapproved technologies are allowed.

## 5. Architectural Constraints

### 5.1 Stateless Backend

Backend services must be stateless.
Authentication must rely on JWT verification.
Server-side sessions are not allowed.

### 5.2 User Isolation

Every request must be scoped to the authenticated user.
User identity must be derived only from verified JWT tokens.
Client-provided user IDs must never be trusted.

### 5.3 Separation of Concerns

The system must be logically divided into:
- Authentication and identity
- Business logic (tasks)
- Infrastructure and integration

## 6. Authentication and Security Model

### 6.1 Authentication Mechanism

Better Auth is used on the frontend.
JWT tokens are issued on successful login.
All API requests must include the token in the Authorization header.

Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

### 6.2 Shared Secret

JWT signing and verification must use the environment variable:

BETTER_AUTH_SECRET

The same secret must be configured in both frontend and backend environments.
Secrets must never be hard-coded.

### 6.3 Authorization Rules

Requests without a valid token must return 401 Unauthorized.
User mismatches must return 403 Forbidden.
Unauthorized data access is strictly prohibited.

## 7. Phase II Feature Scope

### Included Features

- User signup and signin
- JWT-based authentication
- Task creation, reading, updating, and deletion
- Task completion toggling
- Persistent database storage
- Responsive web interface

### Excluded Features

- AI chatbot functionality
- Role-based access control
- Notifications
- Real-time updates
- Offline support

## 8. Required Specifications

Phase II is divided into three mandatory specifications.

### Spec 1: Authentication and User Identity
- Better Auth configuration
- JWT issuance and verification
- API authorization enforcement

### Spec 2: Task Management (CRUD and Ownership)
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Toggle task completion
- Enforce task ownership using authenticated user ID

### Spec 3: Full-Stack Web Integration
- Frontend and backend API integration
- JWT attached to all requests
- SQLModel and Neon PostgreSQL persistence
- UI reflects backend state

Each specification must be independently implementable and testable.

## 9. API Contract

All API endpoints require authentication.
All database queries must be filtered by authenticated user.
The backend must never trust client-supplied user identifiers.

## 10. Development Workflow

The only permitted workflow is:

1. Write or update specification
2. Generate implementation plan using Claude Code
3. Break plan into tasks
4. Execute tasks via Claude Code
5. Review and iterate through spec updates

Skipping steps is not allowed.

## 11. Evaluation Criteria

Projects are evaluated on:

- Specification quality
- Agentic discipline
- Security and correctness
- Architectural clarity and maintainability

## 12. Completion Criteria

Phase II is complete when:

- All three specifications are implemented
- Authentication is enforced on all APIs
- Users can securely manage their own tasks
- Data persists across sessions
- No manual code edits exist

## 13. Forward Compatibility

This constitution is designed to support future phases, including an AI-powered chatbot and MCP tool integration.
Phase II must not introduce constraints that block future expansion.
```

## Response snapshot

Created a new constitution file at .specify/memory/constitution.md based on the provided user input. The constitution defines the rules and constraints for Hackathon Phase II, emphasizing spec-driven development, agentic execution, technology stack requirements, security model, and development workflow. It includes core principles like Spec-Driven Development, Agentic Execution, No Manual Coding Rule, Spec Compliance Rule, Statelessness Requirement, and User Isolation. The document also outlines technology stack requirements, security and authentication model, feature scope, and governance guidelines.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created new constitution file with comprehensive rules for Hackathon Phase II
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with implementing the three required specifications
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear governance framework for the hackathon

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin with Spec 1: Authentication and User Identity
